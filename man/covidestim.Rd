\usage{
covidestim(
  ndays,
  ndays_before = 28,
  chains = 3,
  iter = 300,
  seed = 42,
  adapt_delta = 0.8,
  max_treedepth = 10,
  weekend = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{ndays}{A positive integer. The number of days of input data being
modeled. This should always be set to the number of days in your input data.}

\item{ndays_before}{A positive integer. How many days before the first day
of model data should be modeled?}

\item{chains}{The number of chains to use during MCMC, as passed to
\code{\link[rstan]{sampling}}.}

\item{iter}{The number of iterations to run during MCMC, as passed to
\code{\link[rstan]{sampling}}.}

\item{seed}{A number. The random number generator seed for use in sampling.}

\item{weekend}{A logical scalar. Many regions see decreased testing volumes
during the weekend. If this is a feature of your data, you may want to
experiment with \code{weekend = TRUE}, which will cause the model to
explicitly take this effect into account.}

\item{thin}{A positive integer to specify period for saving samples, as
passed to \code{\link[rstan]{sampling}}.}

\item{rho_sym}{A number in \code{(0, 1]}. Modulates the strength of 
the relationship between the fraction of positive tests and the 
probability of diagnosis for symptomatic, but not severely ill, cases.}

\item{rho_sev}{A number in \code{(0, 1]}. Modulates the strength of 
the relationship between the fraction of positive tests and the 
probability of diagnosis for severely ill cases.}
}
\value{
An S3 object of type \code{covidestim}. This can be passed to 
  \code{\link{run}} to execute the model. This object can also be saved
  to disk using \code{\link[base]{saveRDS}} to enable reproducibility across
  platforms or sessions. The \code{print} method is overloaded to return
  to the user a summary of the configuration, including prior values and 
  the presence or absence of input data.
}
\description{
\code{covidestim} returns a base configuration of the model with the default
set of priors, and no input data. This configuration, after adding input
data (see \code{\link{input_cases}}, \code{\link{input_deaths}}, and
\code{\link{input_fracpos}}), represents a valid model configuration that can
be passed to \code{\link{run}}.
