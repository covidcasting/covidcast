\title{Input observational data}
\usage{
input_cases(data, type = "reported")

input_deaths(data, type = "reported")
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A \code{\link[base]{data.frame}} as described below.}

\item{type}{A string, either \code{"reported"} or \code{"occurred"}.

  \code{"reported"} applies to the following situations:
  \itemize{
    \item Case or death data where the count for a particular day
    represents the number of cases or deaths that were reported publicly on
    that day (for example, as of June 1st, 2020, this is the type of data
      reported by the New York Times'
       \href{https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data}{covid-19-data}
      repository, and by the
      \href{https://covidtracking.org}{Covid Tracking Project}.
    \item Cases or deaths data where the count for a particular day is the 
      number of cases or deaths received from hospital reports, or
      diagnostic laboratories, accumulated across a particular region
  }

  \code{"occurred"} applies to the following situations:
  \itemize{
    \item Data where counts represent the number of of cases or deaths that
      actually occured on that day. For case data, this would be the day a 
      test was administered or the date of symptom onset. For deaths, this 
      would be the day an individual died. Note that, if the deaths data 
      represented the day an individual's death was first reported as a 
      SARS-Cov-2-related death, that data should be passed with 
      \code{type = "reported"}, instead.

\description{
A family of functions used for inputting data into Covidestim.
}
\details{
There are three types of observational data that can be used with Covidestim:

\itemize{
  \item Case data, detailing the number of new cases each day
  \item Death data, detailing the number of confirmed Covid-19 deaths each
  day
  \item Testing data, detailing the fraction of positive tests for each day
  of data. 
}

All input data to Covidestim is expected to be a
\code{\link[base]{data.frame}} of two variables. One variable, \code{date}
must be a vector of type \code{\link[base]{POSIXct}} or
\code{\link[base]{Date}}. The second column, \code{observations} will be a
non-negative numeric vector, except in the case of testing data, where the
column must be a numeric vector between \code{[0,1]}.

Fraction positve data should represent, for a given day, the number of
positive test results reported that day, over the total number of test
results received that day. Note that the model tends to perform poorly on
fraction positive data that contains dramatic jumps. With highly variable 
data, we recommened users smooth the fraction positive data with a moving 
average,for example by using the function \code{\link[smooth]{sma}}. Reasons 
for this variation, as they have manifested in publicly available datasets, 
have included:

\itemize{
  \item \strong{Dumping of test results}: Some states have a tendency to dump 
    batches of results on particular days. 

  \item \strong{Accumulation of test results reported over the weekend}: Many 
    states have lower reporting volume over the weekend, creating an unstable
    fraction positive quantity as the sample size increases and decreases
    dramatically.

  \item \strong{Reclassification of results}: Some states have retroactively changed
    test results, or removed test results entirely, and these changes may 
    manifest on a single day, rather than being applied to all previous
    days affected by the change.

  \item \strong{Antibody tests}: Some states have been pooling antibody tests with
    viral tests, as reported in \href{https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/05/cdc-and-states-are-misreporting-covid-19-test-data-pennsylvania-georgia-texas/611935/}{The Atlantic}, and are now
    removing that pooling from their data.
}

Missing values in cases and deaths data should be represented as \code{0}.
The date range of all sets of data passed to \code{\link{covidestim}} must be
equivalent, with one observation each day, and no gaps in the data.
Assertions attempt to enforce this specification.
