#' Input observational data
#'
#' A family of functions used for inputting data into Covidestim.
#'
#' There are three types of observational data that can be used with Covidestim:
#'
#' \itemize{
#'   \item Case data, detailing the number of new cases each day
#'   \item Death data, detailing the number of confirmed Covid-19 deaths each
#'   day
#'   \item Testing data, detailing the fraction of positive tests for each day
#'   of data. 
#' }
#'
#' All input data to Covidestim is expected to be a
#' \code{\link[base]{data.frame}} of two variables. One variable, \code{date}
#' must be a vector of type \code{\link[base]{POSIXct}} or
#' \code{\link[base]{Date}}. The second column, \code{observations} will be a
#' non-negative numeric vector, except in the case of testing data, where the
#' column must be a numeric vector between \code{[0,1]}.
#'
#' Fraction positve data should represent, for a given day, the number of
#' positive test results reported that day, over the total number of test
#' results received that day. Note that the model tends to perform poorly on
#' fraction positive data that contains dramatic jumps. With highly variable 
#' data, we recommened users smooth the fraction positive data with a moving 
#' average,for example by using the function \code{\link[smooth]{sma}}. Reasons 
#' for this variation, as they have manifested in publicly available datasets, 
#' have included:
#'
#' \itemize{
#'   \item \strong{Dumping of test results}: Some states have a tendency to dump 
#'     batches of results on particular days. 
#'
#'   \item \strong{Accumulation of test results reported over the weekend}: Many 
#'     states have lower reporting volume over the weekend, creating an unstable
#'     fraction positive quantity as the sample size increases and decreases
#'     dramatically.
#'
#'   \item \strong{Reclassification of results}: Some states have retroactively changed
#'     test results, or removed test results entirely, and these changes may 
#'     manifest on a single day, rather than being applied to all previous
#'     days affected by the change.
#'
#'   \item \strong{Antibody tests}: Some states have been pooling antibody tests with
#'     viral tests, as reported in \href{https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/05/cdc-and-states-are-misreporting-covid-19-test-data-pennsylvania-georgia-texas/611935/}{The Atlantic}, and are now
#'     removing that pooling from their data.
#' }
#'
#' Missing values in cases and deaths data should be represented as \code{0}.
#' The date range of all sets of data passed to \code{\link{covidestim}} must be
#' equivalent, with one observation each day, and no gaps in the data.
#' Assertions attempt to enforce this specification.
#'
#' @param data A \code{\link[base]{data.frame}} as described below.
#' @param type A string, either \code{"reported"} or \code{"occurred"}.
#' 
#'   \code{"reported"} applies to the following situations:
#'   \itemize{
#'     \item Case or death data where the count for a particular day
#'     represents the number of cases or deaths that were reported publicly on
#'     that day (for example, as of June 1st, 2020, this is the type of data
#'       reported by the New York Times'
#'        \href{https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data}{covid-19-data}
#'       repository, and by the
#'       \href{https://covidtracking.org}{Covid Tracking Project}.
#'     \item Cases or deaths data where the count for a particular day is the 
#'       number of cases or deaths received from hospital reports, or
#'       diagnostic laboratories, accumulated across a particular region
#'   }
#'
#'   \code{"occurred"} applies to the following situations:
#'   \itemize{
#'     \item Data where counts represent the number of of cases or deaths that
#'       actually occured on that day. For case data, this would be the day a 
#'       test was administered or the date of symptom onset. For deaths, this 
#'       would be the day an individual died. Note that, if the deaths data 
#'       represented the day an individual's death was first reported as a 
#'       SARS-Cov-2-related death, that data should be passed with 
#'       \code{type = "reported"}, instead.
